#What is this?
This is the demostration of how school is blind, holding those who try to do shomething down. We are all sheeps, all white, all the same, no one deserve to be better than the other or worse. School is what is making me regret starting programming and loving mathematics, because I don't see any recognition of my work, but those who are bad, and really are taking us, the school, anyone down, are recognized for any single action they do. If you are a teacher, stop bothering at helping those who can't make it...
